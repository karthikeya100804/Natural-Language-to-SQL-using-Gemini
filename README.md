Ask Your Data: SQL Generator with Gemini
This Streamlit app enables users to upload Excel files, automatically convert them into a SQLite database, and query or manipulate the data using natural language questions. The app uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model to convert your plain English queries into SQL, retrieve results, and even update the database as needed.

🧠 How It Works
Upload your Excel file (.xlsx).

The app loads the data into a local SQLite database.

Ask a question in natural language, like:

"What is the average age of customers?"

"Delete all rows where sales are less than 100."

The app uses Gemini to convert your question into SQL.

SQL is executed and results are shown or updates are applied.

You can download an updated Excel file if changes were made.

🛡️ Safety Notes
Queries like DROP, DELETE, or UPDATE will execute directly on your SQLite database.

Always make a backup if you're working with important data.

🖥️ Running the App
streamlit run your_script_name.py
Replace your_script_name.py with the filename of your main script.
